Things on the map can be identified using the ‘Query Features’
button. A ‘feature’ is something of interest on the map. As you can
see from the list at right, a feature can be anything on the map.
1. From the map controls on the right-hand side of the map,
students should click the ‘Query Features’ button, shown at
right.
2. The cursor will change to a black circle with a white question
mark in the center.
3. Click any feature on the map, which will return a list of
features. Note that the query returns features that enclose
the selected feature as shown in the image to the right.

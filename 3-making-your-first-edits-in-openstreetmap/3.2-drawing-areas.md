Let’s start by adding some buildings. Most times, we map building as polygons, or ‘areas’ as they’re called in OSM. A “polygon” in the iD editor is actually a “closed way” with tags on it.
1. In iD Editor, navigate to your neighborhood or a place very familiar to you such as your school or your street.
2. Find a building that is not added to the map. An unmapped building will be visible on the aerial imagery but missing the pink outline indicating that another OSM user has mapped the building. In the image below, the buildings on the left are mapped but the buildings on the right are not. (If you’re local area is well mapped, try exploring other places you may know.)

3. To add a new building, click on the Area button.

4. Your mouse cursor will change into plus (+) sign. Trace a building using the imagery as a guide. Click on all four (or more) corners of the building. Double-click on the last point to finish.
5. In the left hand panel, search for ‘Building’. For now, just tag it as a generic building. You will notice that the color of your shape will change once you’ve tagged it.
6. Square your building by typing ‘s’ or by right-clicking on the line and select the square option from the context menu as shown below.

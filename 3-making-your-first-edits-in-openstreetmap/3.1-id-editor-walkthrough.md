4. Click on the Edit button on the top left hand corner of the OSM map window, and choose ‘iD

5. Click Start Walkthrough
a. If the Start Walkthrough icon does not pop-up, look for the help icon on the
right-hand toolbar. Select Start Walkthrough from this menu.
6. Go through the iD Walkthrough tutorial. The walkthrough is a brief but comprehensive guide to
help you navigate the iD editor, understand how to add points, lines, and polygons, and how to
add buildings.
None of the data created in the Walkthrough is saved, so you are free to make mistakes and
practice here. However, once you start editing you will need to exercise more caution!

Next we’ll add lines to the map. In most urban areas parking lots and driveways are an easy start and often unmapped. Make sure all road segments connect as shown in the image below.
1. Navigate to a part of the map with parking lots. Commercial areas, school campuses, or business areas are good areas to look for unmapped parking aisles to practice mapping lines.

2. To add a new road, click on the Line button.
3. Your mouse cursor will change into plus (+) sign. Trace the center of the driving lane using the imagery as a guide. Double-click on the last point to finish. The road should start and/or end connected to the existing road network!
4. Tag the line with the appropriate road tag. If mapping a parking aisle, search for ‘Parking Aisle’ in the left hand panel.

Once you’ve mastered the connectivity and road tagging, graduate to bigger roads. Make sure the road is named. Classify roads as ‘residential’ unless you know otherwise.

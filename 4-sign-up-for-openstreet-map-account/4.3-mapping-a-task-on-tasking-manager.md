Preparation
With students, open a task to map and review the following best practices for mapping in the Tasking
Manager before starting:
● Only map within the pink square. If a building crosses the line, use the 60-40 rule: If the building
is more than 50% in your square map it. If it is less than 50% in your square leave it. If it is about
equal, map it.
● Only map what your task is asking for. For example, if the task only requests buildings, do not
map roads and other features.
● Save and upload your edits after every ~20 features added. If your internet connection is not
strong, consider saving and uploading every ~8-10 features mapped.
● Only mark a task as completed if all the target features are mapped. If you run out of time, you
can submit and say that the task is not yet completed.
● If you are unsure about something in the square, leave a comment for the next mapper or
validator. They might have more experience or context to figure out the problem.
● Make sure you are using the requested imagery before starting! You can switch between
imagery for better insight, but you should always map against the requested imagery.
Procedures for students
1. At the bottom of the task selection page, make sure that the editor selected is iD Editor.
2. Select a square from the grid and click Map a task. iD Editor will open within the Tasking
Manager.
3. Before starting to map, survey the area within the pink square to get a sense of what needs to
be mapped and the quantity of features to be mapped.
4. If the square contains features that match the task need (i.e. buildings), zoom in to one to begin
mapping.
5. Use the mapping techniques learned in Module 3 to map all features per the task requirements,
such as all buildings.
6. Remember to save and upload at least every 20 edits. In the upper-right corner of the map box,
Click Save. The number in this button will indicate the current number of unsaved edits.
7. The Upload to OpenStreetMap panel will appear on the left-hand side. Review the Changeset
Comments generated here. Most tasks will have automatically generated hashtags created by
the Project Manager. Do not delete or change these generated hashtags. You may add
hashtags if instructed to do so for the class assignment.
8. Click Upload. This will push your edits to the OpenStreetMap database.
9. Continue editing until the task is complete.
10. Once you’ve mapped all features, review the square closely to make sure no features were
missed, such as buildings covered by tree canopy.
Once you’ve completed task and uploaded all edits. You can submit the task. In the right hand
panel, click Yes under the question ‘Is this task completely mapped?’
If you need to stop mapping but the task is not completed, save and upload your edits. In the
right hand panel, select No.
Only select Imagery is bad if it is not possible to see any features due to the quality of the
imagery or if there is cloud cover across the entire square.
12. Leave a comment for the next mapper or validator if there is any information that would be
helpful for them. For example, if you were unsure if something should be mapped or not. You
may also comment what you completed (i.e. added buildings).
13. Click Submit Task

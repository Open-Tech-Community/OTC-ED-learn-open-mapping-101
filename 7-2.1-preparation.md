Facilitators should familiarize themselves with the content and navigation of the resources students will
explore in this lesson.
1. Explore the OSM Wiki Map Features page -
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features
a. Run a search on the Map Features page.
On a Windows machine, press (and hold) the ‘Control‘ key + click the ‘F’ key. On an Apple
machine, press (and hold) the ‘Command‘ key + click the ‘F’ key.
b. For practice, search for transportation-related keywords such as:
i. “transportation”, “public transport”, “ferry” and “railway”
c. Search for additional features found in your area and compile an introductory list of ~20
to present to students. For example, local non-governmental organization offices such as
the Red Cross and elementary, middle and high schools.
2. Read through the Good Practices page - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice
a. Make a bulleted list of good and bad mapping practices.
b. Review the Good Changeset Comments page. Understand that a changeset is OSM’s
equivalent to a document “save as” or a git version control “commit”.
Students will start off editing using the iD editor. Pay attention to documentation related
to this editor opposed to others including JOSM and Potlatch.

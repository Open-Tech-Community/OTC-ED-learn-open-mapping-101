Ask students to answer the following questions in their journal. This activity could also be done as a
class or group discussion activity.
1. List and give specific examples of at least 20 map features in your neighborhood or the
neighborhoods you frequent most. Do these features tell us anything about our community? Are
these features found in other countries in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa,
Australia or Antarctica or are they only found in North America or your area?
2. Why are good practices important? Read Editing Standards and Conventions. When editing,
how accurate is “accurate enough”? Discuss why you think OSM is so successful when the data
that comprises the map is editable by anyone when anyone could update the features with
inaccurate data?
3. For good practices, do you see anything missing? Do you see any conflict between them? Keep in
mind at all times when contributing to OSM, which would they be?

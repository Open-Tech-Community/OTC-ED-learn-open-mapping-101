In this module, you will be fully prepared to contribute to the OSM project. You will familiarize with the three fundamental resources:
1. **Map features**: the representation of physical things on the ground that together make up the map.
2. **Good practices**: guidelines that increase the quality and value of OSM data.
3. **Getting started**: learn step by step how to navigate the OSM site, view maps, and sign up for a user account.

Please familiarize yourself with the following concept:
1. Explore the OSM Wiki Map Features page -
[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)

   a. Run a search on the Map Features page.

   > On a Windows machine, press (and hold) the ‘Control‘ key + click the ‘F’ key. On an Apple machine, press (and hold) the ‘Command‘ key + click the ‘F’ key.

   b. For practice, search for transportation-related keywords such as:
   > “transportation”, “public transport”, “ferry” and “railway”

   c. Search for additional features found in your area and compile an introductory list of ~20 to present to students. For example, local non-governmental organization offices such as the Red Cross and elementary, middle and high schools.
   
2. Read through the Good Practices page - [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)

a. Make a bulleted list of good and bad mapping practices.

b. Review the Good Changeset Comments page. Understand that a changeset is OSM’s equivalent to a document “save as” or a git version control “commit”.

c. Constant review and student critique relative to these mapping habits is important. As such, this resource should be referred to regularly throughout the course.
3. Learn about navigating the map, viewing different map styles, and searching for features by reviewing the “Browsing the Map” section on the OSM Wiki Browsing page -

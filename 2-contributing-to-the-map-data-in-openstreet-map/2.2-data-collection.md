For this section of the course, you will need to create and save files. This section is about assessing your knowledge. You can use Online Drives or create files in your local computer. This activity could also be done as a group discussion activity. If you are doing this in a group it is better that you keep the files online so that it is easy to share.
1. List and give specific examples of at least 20 map features in your neighborhood or the neighborhoods you frequent most. Do these features tell us anything about our community? Are these features found in other countries in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia or Antarctica or are they only found in Asia or your area?
2. Why are good practices important? Read Editing Standards and Conventions. When editing, how accurate is “accurate enough”? In group, discuss why you think OSM is so successful when the data that comprises the map is editable by anyone when anyone could update the features with inaccurate data?
3. For good practices, do you see anything missing? Do you see any conflict between them? Keep in mind at all times when contributing to OSM, which would they be?

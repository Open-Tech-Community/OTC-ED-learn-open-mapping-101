Things on the map can be identified using the ‘Query Features’ button. A ‘feature’ is something of interest on the map. As you can see from the list at right, a feature can be anything on the map.
1. From the map controls on the right-hand side of the map, you should click the ‘Query Features’ button.

2. The cursor will change to a black circle with a white question mark in the center.
3. Click any feature on the map, which will return a list of features. Note that the query returns features that enclose the selected feature as shown in the image to the right.

In this activity, you and your students will use Nominatim, OpenStreetMap’s gazetteer function to focus
the map on a specific place, such as a town, a city, or location.
1. Students should point their browsers to openstreetmap.org
2. In the search box (shown below), students should enter a place name, e.g. ‘Fargo North Dakota’
and hit ‘return’.
3. The left-hand pane will display a list of search results, if there are more than one. The map will
be centered over the first result in the list.
4. Students may re-center the map by selecting a different entry in the list OR by panning around
the map using the mouse (see Using the Map Controls, below).

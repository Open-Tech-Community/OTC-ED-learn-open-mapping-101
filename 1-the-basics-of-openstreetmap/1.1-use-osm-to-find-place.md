In this first lesson, you will go through activities which will help you understand how to navigate and focus on different locations.You will use Nominatim, OpenStreetMap’s gazetteer function to focus the map on a specific place, such as a town, a city, or location.

**Instructions**:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to openstreetmap.org.
2. Locate the search box on the website. In the search box (shown below), students should enter a place name, e.g. ‘Kathmandu’ and hit ‘return’.

4. The left-hand pane will display a list of search results, if there are more than one. The map will be centered over the first result in the list.
5. You may re-center the map by selecting a different entry in the list OR by panning around the map using the mouse (see Using the Map Controls, below).

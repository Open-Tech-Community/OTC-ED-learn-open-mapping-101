Finally we’ll add a point feature to the map - often referred to as Points of Interest. On OpenStreetMap,
some of the most common features mapped as points include businesses, bus stops, and even trees.
1. Navigate to your school ground or a nearby park.
2. Click the ‘Point’ button. Your mouse cursor will change into plus (+) sign.
3. Now, click on the center of a tree. Only one click is needed for Point features.
4. In the left hand panel, search for ‘Tree’. You will notice that it is possible to add features such as
tree type and height. For now, leave everything besides the tree tag blank.
Once you’ve mastered adding points, you can add more advanced point features such as
businesses. Remember: it’s important to only add what you know and can verify! We wouldn’t
want to send someone to a place that does not exist.

Considerations for signing up large numbers of individuals at once.
⇢ Prior to beginning the OSM registration process, all individuals signing up for OSM accounts will
need to have an existing and accessible email account. If registering a large group of individuals
at one time, we recommend asking the group if they have accessible email accounts. If
facilitators are unsure if all students have email addresses, we also recommend planning for
time in assisting individuals with setting up email accounts.
⇢ Consider internet connectivity and capacity prior to registering large numbers of individuals for
OSM accounts. Having individuals taking turns to register or running registration simultaneous to
other activities can reduce the load on a slow internet connection.
⇢ It is crucial that usernames and passwords are remembered by participants so that they can
access other tools that require OSM accounts to log-in. We recommend encouraging participants
to find a way of safely storing this information for future reference.
⇢ Facilitators should record OSM usernames and student names when students register. This will
help facilitate assessment later on.
⇢ Advise students on how to choose a good username before students begin to sign up. Ensure
they
○ Do NOT use their email address as a username
○ Do NOT put spaces in their username. E.g. “MapMaker”, but not “Map Maker”
